    <h2>DESIGN의 속성</h2>


    <p>Metals are generally hard and glossy, encompassing materials with high thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity.
         Chemistry is used to describe metastatic metals and post-transfer metals,
          but sometimes quasi-metals are included in the definition of metals. </p>
          Generally present in a solid state at room temperature, having a characteristic gloss and a well-translated conductor of heat and electricity,
          having ductility and preciseness. Approximately three-quarters of the 118 elements located on the periodic table correspond to the general definition of metal. </p>
          Iron, copper, aluminum, gold, tin and uranium are commonly found in natural conditions. Usually, metal elements lose electrons and are prone to cation, while nonmetals are,<p> 
           on the contrary, more likely to obtain electrons. In astronomy, elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are also called metals..</p>
