    attractiveness, etc.) in the process of industrial design, which may involve design research,
    thinking, experimental models, interactive experiments and coordination,</p><p>
    and redesign processes prior to the creation process. Therefore, <u>design</u> as a process has many different methods and 
    forms depending on how the object is designed,</p>
